## Architecture Principles

### Pure Object-Oriented Design
- Everything is an object (numbers, classes, methods, stack frames)
- All computation happens through message sending
- No primitive types or special syntax constructs
- Uniform object model throughout the system

### Live Programming Environment
- Image-based development with persistent object state
- Interactive modification of running code
- Immediate feedback through workspaces
- Debugging with live code modification

### Reflective System
- Complete introspection capabilities
- Runtime modification of classes and methods
- Self-describing system structure
- Metaclass architecture for class behavior

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient method lookup with caching
- Generational garbage collection
- Bytecode interpretation with optional JIT
- Optimized primitive operations

### Interoperability Design
- Seamless .st file format for visual program persistence
- Bidirectional Smalltalk â†” Rust transpilation
- Zero-overhead Rust library integration
- Preserve Smalltalk semantics in generated Rust code

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test every class and method
- Mock external dependencies
- Property-based testing for mathematical operations
- Boundary condition testing

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Verify message passing between objects
- Test class hierarchy inheritance
- Validate garbage collection behavior

### System Testing
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory leak detection
- Stress testing with large object graphs

5. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented Rust code

## Contributing

This implementation follows the Smalltalk-80 specification as documented in the "Blue Book" (Smalltalk-80: The Language and its Implementation). All contributions should maintain the pure object-oriented nature and live programming capabilities that make Smalltalk unique.

### Key Requirements
- Preserve Smalltalk semantics in .st format and Rust transpilation
- Maintain 100% test coverage including roundtrip conversions
- Support idiomatic Rust code generation
- Enable seamless Rust ecosystem integration

### Development Workflow
1. Write failing tests first (TDD approach)
2. Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Run `cargo tarpaulin` to verify coverage targets
5. All PRs must maintain or improve coverage percentage
